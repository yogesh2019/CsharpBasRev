7 C sharp vs Dot net
c sharp is a programmin language
.net is a framework for building applications on Windows
there are diff lang that can target .dotnet framework
F sharp and vb .net


.net framework consists of two components
CLR
class Library

before c sharp we had two families in C

the compiler tranlates our code into a native code

so if a took a application of built for 80 86 architecture lang

that will not run on linux as the version is different

in java the code is translated into bytecode

now we need something that compiles our IL code to the native code

that is the job of CLR

and this process is called JIT

so with this you dont have to worry about the machines on which we will be runing our code




////// Architeture of .Net Applications
application is made of building blocks called classes
these collaborate with each other in runtime
so as a result the application provides some functionality

class
is just a container 
consisting of data and methods

Car
make
Model
Color

Start()
Move()

in real world all classes have different responsibility

for ex getting the data from the user

--name spaces

now as there are no of classes  

we need a way to organise these classes

that is where we use the namespace

namespace is a container for related classes

for ex we have namespace for working with data like databases

we also have namespaces for working with graphics and images



now in real world as these app grow we need a diff way of partitioning an application and 

and that is where we use assembly

an assembly is a container for related namespaces

physically its a file on the disk

which is exec 
and it is dll

dynamically linked library

so when you compile and application

the compiler builds one or more assembly

depending on how you partition your code

in which we are going to see all the concepts in action
