7 C sharp vs Dot net
c sharp is a programmin language
.net is a framework for building applications on Windows
there are diff lang that can target .dotnet framework
F sharp and vb .net


.net framework consists of two components
CLR
class Library

before c sharp we had two families in C

the compiler tranlates our code into a native code

so if a took a application of built for 80 86 architecture lang

that will not run on linux as the version is different

in java the code is translated into bytecode

now we need something that compiles our IL code to the native code

that is the job of CLR

and this process is called JIT

so with this you dont have to worry about the machines on which we will be runing our code
