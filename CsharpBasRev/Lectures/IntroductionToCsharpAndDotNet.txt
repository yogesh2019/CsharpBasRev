7 C sharp vs Dot net
c sharp is a programmin language
.net is a framework for building applications on Windows
there are diff lang that can target .dotnet framework
F sharp and vb .net


.net framework consists of two components
CLR
class Library

before c sharp we had two families in C

the compiler tranlates our code into a native code

so if a took a application of built for 80 86 architecture lang

that will not run on linux as the version is different

in java the code is translated into bytecode

now we need something that compiles our IL code to the native code

that is the job of CLR

and this process is called JIT

so with this you dont have to worry about the machines on which we will be runing our code




////// Architeture of .Net Applications
application is made of building blocks called classes
these collaborate with each other in runtime
so as a result the application provides some functionality

class
is just a container 
consisting of data and methods

Car
make
Model
Color

Start()
Move()

in real world all classes have different responsibility

for ex getting the data from the user

--name spaces

now as there are no of classes  

we need a way to organise these classes

that is where we use the namespace

namespace is a container for related classes

for ex we have namespace for working with data like databases

we also have namespaces for working with graphics and images



now in real world as these app grow we need a diff way of partitioning an application and 

and that is where we use assembly

an assembly is a container for related namespaces

physically its a file on the disk

which is exec 
and it is dll

dynamically linked library

so when you compile and application

the compiler builds one or more assembly

depending on how you partition your code

in which we are going to see all the concepts in action




******************************

in C sharp we have solution

in a very simple application we have only one solution and one project

now let see what is happening here

so currently under solution we have one project
under properties 

we have a file here called assemblies

whenever we compile an application we are gonna get an executable

under list of references

you will see the any number of assemblies that this solution is using

app.config is and xml where we store configuration for this application

sometimes connection strings in a database

or you may want to have some settings in your applications


in program.cs 

you see a bunch of using statements


so since our project is called helloworld, when you write code in this namespace



so if you want to use a class that is define in different namespace, 

all we need to do is import our code, 

so here we have these basic classes

system.threading is used to build multithreading application

in this we are create a very simple application and not gonna use any of the namespaces here

as we create a program in visual studio

it creates a new class called program

we have a function called main

and this is the entry point to our app

so when we execute app

CLR executes our main method and then everything kicks off 

this method is declared as static

what we have is input or output

note that params are optional

curly stands for block of code

methods are indicated by purple cube

beep is used to play beep sound

now if take a look at system at the top we will see that its hightlighted

you can press alt + enter

************** summary

So in this section, you learned the basics of C#.

C# vs .NET

C# is a programming language, while .NET is a framework. It consists of a run-time environment (CLR) and a class library that we use for building applications.

CLR

When you compile an application, C# compiler compiles your code to IL (Intermediate Language) code. IL code is platform agnostics, which makes it possible to a take a C# program on a different computer with different hardware architecture and operating system and run it. For this to happen, we need CLR. When you run a C# application, CLR compiles the IL code into the native machine code for the computer on which it is running. This process is called Just-in-time Compilation (JIT).

Architecture of .NET Applications

In terms of architecture, an application written with C# consists of building blocks called classes. A class is a container for data (attributes) and methods (functions). Attributes represent the state of the application. Methods include code. They have logic. That's where we implement our algorithms and write code.

A namespace is a container for related classes. So as your application grows in size, you may want to group the related classes into various namespaces for better maintainability.

As the number of classes and namespaces even grow further, you may want to physically separate related namespaces into separate assemblies. An assembly is a file (DLL or EXE) that contains one or more namespaces and classes. An EXE file represents a program that can be executed. A DLL is a file that includes code that can be re-used across different programs.

In the next section, you'll learn about basics of the C# language, including variables, constants, type conversion and operators.
